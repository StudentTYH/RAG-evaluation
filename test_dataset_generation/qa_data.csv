8,What specific task did Jakob Uszkoreit start working on according to the abstract?,Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea.
9,What is the dimension of dmodel mentioned in the text?,dmodel = 512.
10,How many identical layers does the decoder consist of according to the passage?,The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.
11,"What additional sub-layer does the decoder have compared to the encoder, as mentioned in the text?","In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack."
12,How are residual connections and layer normalization used in the decoder according to the passage?,"We employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization."
13,What modification is made to the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack as described in the text?,"The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack is modified to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i."
14,What does an attention function map according to the passage?,"An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors."
15,How is the Scaled Dot-Product Attention defined in the text?,"We call our particular attention 'Scaled Dot-Product Attention' (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values."
16,What is the formula for computing the matrix of outputs in Scaled Dot-Product Attention as given in the text?,"The matrix of outputs is computed as: \[ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \]"
17,What scaling factor is used in the algorithm described?,of 1/√dk
18,How does additive attention compute the compatibility function?,Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.

20,For what values of dk does the text suggest that additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling?,Without scaling for larger values of dk
21,What is the effect of large dot products on the softmax function according to the text?,"we suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients."
22,"How many times do queries, keys and values get linearly projected in multi-head attention?","the queries, keys and values h times"
23,What is the purpose of using multiple heads in multi-head attention as described in the text?,"Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values."
24,What is the final result of multi-head attention as described?,"These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values"
25,How does multi-head attention allow the model to attend to information differently compared to a single attention head?,"Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this."
26,How many parallel attention layers (or heads) does the model employ?,h = 8 parallel attention layers.
27,What is the value of dk and dv for each head in these attention layers?,For each of these we use dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64.
28,Why is the total computational cost similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality despite using multiple heads?,"Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality."
29,"In which layers does the Transformer use 'encoder-decoder attention' and what are the sources of queries, keys, and values in these layers?","In 'encoder-decoder attention' layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder."
30,How do self-attention layers function within the encoder according to the text?,"In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder."
31,What is the purpose of implementing masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax for self-attention layers in the decoder?,We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. This is done to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property.
32,What does FFN(x) represent in the context of the text?,"FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 represents the position-wise feed-forward networks applied to each position separately and identically."

37,How are the weights in the embedding layers adjusted?,"in the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel."
38,"What types of layers are compared in Table 1, and what is their complexity per layer?","Table 1 compares Self-Attention, Recurrent, Convolutional, and Self-Attention (restricted) layers. The complexity per layer for Self-Attention is O(n2 · d), for Recurrent it is O(n · d2), for Convolutional it is O(k · n · d2), and for Self-Attention (restricted) it is O(r · n · d)."
39,What information does the model need to use the order of sequence tokens?,"Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence."
40,How do they add positional encodings to the input embeddings?,"To this end, we add 'positional encodings' to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks."
41,What is the formula for calculating the positional encoding values?,"In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^2i/dmodel), PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^2i/dmodel), where pos is the position and i is the dimension."
42,What type of progression is used to form the positional encoding from 2π to 10000 · 2π?,forms a geometric progression
43,Why was the sinusoidal version of positional encoding chosen over learned positional embeddings?,We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.
44,What are the three desiderata considered in comparing self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers?,"One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network."
45,How does a self-attention layer compare to a recurrent layer in terms of computational complexity?,"A self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations."
46,What is one key factor affecting the ability to learn long-range dependencies in sequence transduction tasks?,One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network.
47,What condition must be met for self-attention layers to be faster than recurrent layers?,"In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d,"
48,How does the restriction of self-attention to a neighborhood size affect the maximum path length in the input sequence?,"To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r)."
49,What is the computational complexity of a single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n?,A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions.
50,How many convolutional layers are required for a stack in the case of contiguous kernels to connect all pairs of input and output positions?,"Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,"
51,"What is the computational complexity of separable convolutions, and how does it compare to self-attention layers?","Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model."
52,What additional benefit do self-attention models offer according to the text?,"As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences."
